# Welcome to XYZZY

## The first magic word

The term "xyzzy" was a magic word in the
[Colossal Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure#Xyzzy)
adventure game written so long ago, it could be played on an actual
[tty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter).  Generally, when this
word was typed in, the game would respond "Nothing happens."  The word
would only work at certain places at certain times in the game, and would
instantly take you to another part of the cave.
