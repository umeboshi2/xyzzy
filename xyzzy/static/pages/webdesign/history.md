## The beginning

The [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) was
envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee to be a protocol usable by computers on
the internet to interlink resources, e.g. text, images, and other files or
structured data.  The resources were to be identified by Universal
Resource Locations, known as "urls."  At the time, even though generic
resources were envisioned, there was not much to share except for text
documents, and Tim Berners-Lee designed a markup language (based on another
more generalized language known as sgml) to format the documents and
provide the links to other documents (on either the same, or remote
computers) through
[anchors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Anchor).

## The image tag

It was a few years later that [Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape)
added the [img](http://www.webmonkey.com/2008/09/history_of_img_and_embed_tags/)
tag to the language, allowing for pictures to be viewed inside the
documents retrieved on the browser.  Many people, including Tim Berners-Lee,
found the addition of this tag as objectionable, however the addition
stuck and the language, standards, and browsers evolved to implement this
way of displaying images.
