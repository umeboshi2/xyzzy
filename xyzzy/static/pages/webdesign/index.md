# Web Design

Here is a collection of pages describing web design, describing what
the [world wide web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web)
actually is, some of the history behind
it, and material describing the issues of design in more detail.

## Introduction

The world wide web (www) is a concept where "resources" stored or
generated on computers are interlinked with other resources that may
either be on other computers on a network.  A simplified history of
the web and how things came to be is located
[here](#frontdoor/view/webdesign/history).  The web browser you are
using has been changing over the years from a browser that views
documents, to a portal that uses applications provided by a person
in a [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) to
interact with resources on the web.

## Browse a Web Site

There was a time where the information that we provided to others
consisted of a directory of files (and subdirectories, and files ...).
This tree of information was composed of html web pages, images, and
other files that a site would want to share with the people who access
the site.  The url, for most intents and purposes, was just the name
of a file on another computer.

The search engine concept, employed today by
[Yahoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!) and
[Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) were inspired by this
concept of "spidering" the
directory of each computer serving resources on the web, so that
the web could actually be "searched" for content.  The spidering
concept depended on the web pages having links to resources.
Although the servers on the web were generally serving content
from a directory on their computer, due to the nature of the web
and [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol),
the search engines (spiders) were only able
to interpret the web pages and gather the links on those pages
to find more resources.


## Stylesheets

This [page](#frontdoor/view/webdesign/stylesheets) describes how
stylesheets are created for this site.


## Javascript Components

This [page](#frontdoor/view/webdesign/javascript-components) describes the
javascript that is used to create an interactive website.

## Development Environment

This [page](#frontdoor/view/webdesign/development) describes how the
application code for the browser is built and deployed.
